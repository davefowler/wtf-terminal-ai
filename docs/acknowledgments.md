# Acknowledgments

Projects that made this possible.

## Inspiration

**tAI (Terminal AI)**
https://github.com/AbanteAI/tAI

The original. Proved you could have an AI in your terminal that actually helps.

We took the concept, added production features (permissions, memory, hooks), and built something you can actually use daily.

## Critical Dependencies

**llm by Simon Willison**
https://github.com/simonw/llm

Model abstraction layer that Just Worksâ„¢. Supports Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and local models.

Without this, we'd be maintaining API client code for every provider. Hard pass.

**Rich by Will McGugan**
https://github.com/Textualize/rich

Terminal UI library that doesn't make you hate yourself.

Permission prompts, spinners, panels - all Rich. Beautiful terminal output with minimal effort.

## Influenced By

**Aider**
https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider

Showed that AI + version control is actually useful, not just a gimmick.

Watching Aider make intelligent code changes proved AI could understand project context. We applied that lesson to terminal context.

**GitHub Copilot CLI**
https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-cli

GitHub's take on terminal AI. Good for suggestions.

We wanted execution, not just suggestions. Different goals, different tools.

## Thanks To

- **Anthropic** - Claude models that actually follow instructions
- **OpenAI** - GPT models for fallback
- **Python** - Language that doesn't fight you
- **pytest** - Testing framework that makes sense

## Philosophy Credit

The Gilfoyle/Marvin personality isn't accidental:

**Gilfoyle** (Silicon Valley) - Sarcastic but competent
**Marvin** (Hitchhiker's Guide) - Depressed but brilliant

Both characters: Supremely capable, mildly contemptuous, always technically correct.

That's the vibe.

If you make something cool, let us know. If you don't, that's fine too.
