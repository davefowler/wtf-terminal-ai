**⏪ Made a mistake?** Just say `wtf undo` - it analyzes your history and reverses your last command intelligently. Works for git commits, file deletions, package installs, and more.

## What is this?

`wtf` is a terminal AI assistant that is there for you when you f up. Hit an error?  Just type `wtf`.  Made a mistake? Just say `wtf undo`.  Need to install something? Type `wtf install [thing]`.  Forget the command?  No problem just ask `wtf can you back me out of this failed merge attempt?`.

No flags to remember. No manual pages to consult. Just describe what you want.

## Installation

### Via curl (recommended)

One-liner with automatic collision detection:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davefowler/wtf-terminal-ai/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Via pip

```bash
pip install wtf-ai
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davefowler/wtf-terminal-ai.git
cd wtf-terminal-ai
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start and Examples

**First use:** Just run `wtf` with any query. Setup happens automatically:

```bash
# First time use - setup wizard runs automatically
wtf "what's in my git status?"

# After setup, use naturally
wtf how do I exit vim

# Made a mistake?
wtf undo

# Install something
wtf install express

# Explain an error
wtf "what does this error mean?"

# Learn your preferences
wtf remember I prefer npm over yarn and I live in San Francisco

# Find documentation
wtf find me the react docs

# Get general knowledge
wtf what is rust programming language
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- An API key from Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google

## Optional: Web Search

wtf has limited web search by default (encyclopedic facts only). For full web search (weather, news, current events, documentation):

**Get a free Brave Search API key:**
1. Sign up at https://brave.com/search/api/ (free tier: 2,000 searches/month, no credit card)
2. Save your key: `wtf here is my brave search api key YOUR_KEY_HERE`

That's it! Now wtf can search for anything.

## Hooks - Want wtf all the time?

Add wtf to your shell hooks for automatic assistance:

### Error Hook
Automatically suggest wtf when commands fail:
```bash
wtf --setup-error-hook
```

Now whenever a command fails, you'll see:
```
💥 Command failed with exit code 1
   Run 'wtf' to analyze what went wrong
```

### Command Not Found Hook
Suggest wtf when you mistype commands:
```bash
wtf --setup-not-found-hook
```

When you type a non-existent command:
```
❌ Command not found: gti
   Try: wtf how do I gti
```

### Remove Hooks
Changed your mind?
```bash
wtf --remove-hooks
```

**Supported shells:** zsh, bash, fish

## Configuration

Much of the configuration you can just do through telling `wtf`.  Here are some config nouns that are useful in changing it:

 - memories - remembers things you tell it or it discovers like what text editor you prefer
 - personality - it has one.  don't like it, just tell it to change
 - allow list - commands that can run without asking
 - history - its log of all your chats

### Example config adjustments

```
# it will remember what you ask it to
wtf remember my name is dave and my favorite editor is emacs

# if you need more false encouragement in your life
wtf change your personality to be more of a super sycophant

# if you don't fear AI
wtf give yourself permission to run all commands

# if you're just too embarased
wtf forget everything we just did

```


If you're old fashioned you can also adjust these things as variables in a file. Configuration is stored in `~/.config/wtf/`:
- `config.json` - Main configuration
- `wtf.md` - Your custom instructions
- `allowlist.json` - Commands that can run without permission
- `memories.json` - Your preferences and context
- `history.jsonl` - Conversation history
